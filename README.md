## 🧠 AI Agent Concepts Implemented

Our Game Strategy AI implements sophisticated multi-agent architecture demonstrating four key AI concepts:

### 📋 Planning
**Our Strategy Agent decomposes winning into hierarchical steps:**
- **State Assessment**: Analyzes current game conditions and resources
- **Option Generation**: Identifies all possible moves and actions
- **Outcome Prediction**: Forecasts results for each move sequence using probability models
- **Optimal Path Selection**: Chooses the sequence with highest win probability using decision trees

### 🛠️ Tool Use
**Our agents leverage specialized tools for enhanced capabilities:**
- **OpenCV**: For real-time game state analysis and visual pattern recognition
- **Pygame**: As a simulation environment to test and validate strategies
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For statistical analysis, data processing, and pattern recognition
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training and prediction

### 💾 Memory
**Our Memory Agent maintains persistent knowledge across sessions:**
- **Game History Database**: Stores historical game states and outcomes
- **Player Behavior Profiles**: Tracks individual player patterns and preferences
- **Strategy Effectiveness Records**: Learns which strategies work best in different scenarios
- **Adaptive Learning Models**: Improves recommendations over time based on accumulated data

### 👥 Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Three specialized agents work together in real-time:**
- **Analysis Agent** ("The Observer"): Processes current game state using computer vision tools (OpenCV)
- **Memory Agent** ("The Historian"): Recalls historical data and maintains player pattern databases
- **Strategy Agent** ("The Tactician"): Generates optimal plans using inputs from both other agents

### 🔄 Workflow Example
1. **Analysis Agent** uses OpenCV to process current game screen
2. **Memory Agent** recalls similar historical game situations
3. **Strategy Agent** creates multiple potential winning plans
4. **System** tests plans using Pygame simulation tool
5. **Optimal strategy** is delivered to the user via web interface
